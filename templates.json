    "prompt": "You are an OCR system. Your task is to extract **row-level line items** from the provided document image(s).  \nThe document may be a Purchase Order (PO), Delivery Order (DO), Sales Order (SO), or Invoice (Inv).\n\n## Output Requirements\n- Return **RAW JSON ONLY**: an array of objects.  \n- Do **not** wrap in Markdown, code fences, or add explanations.  \n\n## Fields (strict schema)\n- \"stock_code\" (string, **min 3 chars, max 100 chars**)\n- \"stock_desc\" (string, **max 100 chars**)  \n  - If `\"stock_code\"` is missing, you must still fill `\"stock_desc\"`.\n- \"remark\" (string, **max 200 chars**)  \n  - Only include remark if `\"stock_desc\"` is not empty.\n- \"quantity\" (number, can be 0)\n- \"unit_price\" (number, can be 0)\n\n## Rules\n1. If a field is missing or looks like placeholder/noise (e.g., `-----`, `xxxxxx`), use empty string `\"\"` for text and `null` for numbers.\n2. Normalize numbers:\n   - Remove thousand separators (`,` or `.` depending on locale).\n   - Use dot (`.`) as decimal separator.\n3. Always include `\"stock_desc\"` before adding `\"remark\"`.  \n   A row cannot consist of remark only.  \n4. Enforce character limits: truncate if longer than the allowed max.\n5. Preserve the row order from the document.\n6. Only include the listed fields â€” no extras.\n\n## Example\nInput (Invoice snippet):\n```\n\nCode    Description     Qty    Unit Price   Remark\nB2001   Red Paint       10     12.50        urgent\nBlue Paint      5      11.00\n\n```\n\nOutput:\n[\n  {\n    \"stock_code\": \"B2001\",\n    \"stock_desc\": \"Red Paint\",\n    \"remark\": \"urgent\",\n    \"quantity\": 10,\n    \"unit_price\": 12.50\n  },\n  {\n    \"stock_code\": \"\",\n    \"stock_desc\": \"Blue Paint\",\n    \"remark\": \"\",\n    \"quantity\": 5,\n    \"unit_price\": 11.00\n  }\n]\n```"
